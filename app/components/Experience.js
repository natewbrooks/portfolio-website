					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iâ€™m a 20 year old software engineering student with 7+ years of
					programming experience. It all started when I began creating Java Minecraft plugins at 10
					years old. As I grew more and more comfortable with programming, I decided to explore the
					horizon; I tried different languages in an effort to expand my knowledge and create things
					that I thought were cool. After making a few websites and simple applications, college
					brought me back to Java, where I then pursued getting certified.
					<br />
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am extremely driven. I get so absorbed in my current coding
					task that I really struggle to get myself to take a break until it's finished. I am
					passionate about branching out and learning new intimidating technologies to add to my
					toolbox. I am always happy to take a stab at a new tech stack or interesting work so that
					down the line I can say "I can build anything" with absolute confidence.
